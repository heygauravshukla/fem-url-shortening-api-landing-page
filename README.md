## My Process

### Built With

- **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)** - Fast, disk-space-efficient package manager
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** - The React framework for the web
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - JavaScript with static typing
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **[clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) & [tailwind-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge)** - For efficiently handling class names
- **[prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)** - A Prettier plugin that automatically sorts Tailwind classes
- **[Clean URI API](https://cleanuri.com/)** - Used for URL shortening

### What I Learned

- Ensuring **type safety with TypeScript**
- Creating **icons as React components** to dynamically change properties on hover and other states
- Avoiding immediate transitions to **newly released library versions** due to potential instability (e.g., **Tailwind CSS v4** lacks proper documentation and support, so waiting 3-4 months until it's stable is ideal)
- Using **clsx** and **tailwind-merge** to create a utility function for reusable components
- Understanding the **POST method in the Fetch API** and how it works
- Utilizing **localStorage** for persistent data storage

### Continued Development

- Enhancing **accessibility and performance**
- Improving **design accuracy** to better match the original challenge
- Implementing **best practices** for code readability and maintainability
